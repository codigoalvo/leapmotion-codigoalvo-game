leapmotion-codigoalvo-game
==========================

My first LeapMotion Game.
It's about grabing a object with a specific color and drag
into objects from same color avoiding colide with diferent ones.
It's on initial stage and I'm doing it from scratch using Java2D and Leap SDK only.
At some point I will put gravitational forces on game to
change direction from objects and some inteligence on object creation.
